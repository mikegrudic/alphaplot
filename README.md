# alphaplot
A living data compilation of IMF slope measurements, replicating and extending the "Alpha-plot" of Scalo 1998 Kroupa 2002. The data are in alphaplot.csv which is editable in any spreedsheet editor (e.g. Excel, Sheets, Calc). 

I make no guarantee of completeness - apologies if your data have been left out. Contributions or corrections are welcome via pull request. This is intended to be a *living* compilation supported by the community.

If you open the [PDF version](https://data.obs.carnegiescience.edu/starforge/IMF_AlphaPlot.pdf) you can click on the datapoints and it will take you to the ADS page!
