# alphaplot
A living data compilation of IMF slope measurements, replicating and extending the "Alpha-plot" of Scalo 1998 Kroupa 2002. The data are in alphaplot.csv which is editable in any spreedsheet editor (e.g. Excel, Sheets, Calc). The plot appears in the [Hennebelle & Grudic 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07301v1) ARAA review, which is the preferred citation *for the compilation work*. Please remember to cite respective authors for their individual data.

This comes with no guarantee of completeness - apologies if your data have been left out. This is intended to be a *living* compilation supported by the community.

This also comes with no guarantee of *homogeneity* - we are simply reporting the inferred IMF slopes reported by different authors in a given mass interval.

If you open the [PDF version](https://data.obs.carnegiescience.edu/starforge/IMF_AlphaPlot.pdf) you can click on the datapoints and it will take you to the ADS page!
